    TheBenedictus = 'Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel he has come to his people and set them free.\
        He has raised up for us a mighty savior,\
        born of the house of his servant David.\
        Through his holy prophets he promised of old\
        that he would save us from our enemies,\
        from the hands of all who hate us.\
        He promised to show mercy to our fathers\
        and to remember his holy covenant.\
        This was the oath he swore to our father\
        Abraham:\
        to set us free from the hands of our enemies,\
        free to worship him without fear,\
        holy and righteous in his sight all the days of our life.\
        You, my child, shall be called the prophet of the Most High;\
        for you will go before the Lord to prepare his way,\
        to give his people knowledge of salvation \
        by the forgiveness of their sins.\
        In the tender compassion of our God\
        the dawn from on high shall break upon us,\
        to shine on those who dwell in darkness and the shadow of death,\
        and to guide our feet into the way of peace.\
        Glory to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit,\
        as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be forever. Amen.'

        we place ourselves under your motherly protection. Throughout the Church's \
        history you have helped Christians in times of trial, temptation and danger. \
        Time and time again, you have proven to be the Refuge of sinners, the Hope of the\
        hopeless, the Consoler of the afflicted, and the Comforter of the dying. We \
        promise to be faithful disciples of Jesus Christ, your Son, to proclaim His Good News\
        of God's love for all people, and to work for peace and justice in our world. With faith\
        in your intercession, we pray for the Church, for our family and friends, for the poor and\
        abandoned, and all the dying. Grant, O Mary, Help of Christians, the graces of which we stand\
        in need. (Mention your intentions.) May we serve Jesus with fidelity and love until death. Help\
        us and our loved ones to attain the boundless joy of being forever with our Father in heaven. Amen.\
        Mary, Help of Christians, pray for us!"
